This report describes the cybersecurity assessment of Qwant, a privacy-focused search engine based in Paris, France. It differs from mainstream search engines in that it provides relevant search results while avoiding data monetization and maintains user privacy. Revenue is generated through non-intrusive methods: contextual advertising and commission-based revenue.
